# Project Simple Take Out Order System.
This is a project for my family member to make orders and keep in track of balance.
I planned to use a template HTML ans CSS, since the main cause of this is to get myself to be famillar with SpringBoot backend and brush up Java skills.

So far I finished planning the API, and got a Maven running.

Update: 
Now I finished a get API, and finished setting up the API! 
Done with Order API, ready to go futher, and trying make sure chinese will work(for now chinese will response with 500)

For the record, I'm Benson or benwater12, both of which are me.

Messing around with git settings.
